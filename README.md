# Cogs 118A - Final Project

### Supervised Machine Learning Comparison

Using dataset found at the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php), the aim is to replicate the study [An Empirical Comparison of Supervised Learning Algorithms, Caruana 2006](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~caruana/ctp/ct.papers/caruana.icml06.pdf). Limiting to 3 algorithms and 3 datasets.

#### Data Sets:

Adult: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult \
EEG Eye State: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/EEG+Eye+State \
Covertype: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype \
\*~~MoCap Hand Postures: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/MoCap+Hand+Postures~~

\* *MoCap data was abandoned, for lack of approach toward large amounts of missing features*


#### Algorithms

SVM \
Random Forests \
Naive Bayes
